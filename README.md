# Course Intelligent Search Algorithms with Python

### Course Description
Problem-solving through search algorithms is an important branch of Artificial Intelligence, being responsible for several practical applications used in our daily lives, such as the mechanism to find the shortest route on a GPS device.

This course has a theoretical and practical view of this area, applying all the concepts in a practical project that will aim to apply the algorithms to find the shortest route between two cities.  It used two approaches: the search without information and the search with information. The first does not have intelligence and is composed of the search algorithms in width and depth, while the second approach was implemented through the greedy search and A * search algorithms (A Estrela). This last algorithm is widely used in games and it was it that gave rise to the GPS (Global Position System) technology that we use a lot in our day to day! It was the Python language to implement the project, however, the source code can be easily ported to other languages.

### What I have learned in the course:
  - I learned in theory and practice about search without information and search with information/heuristics
  - I understood the practical operation of greedy search algorithms, A * search (star), width search and depth search
  - I learned step by step how to develop an algorithm to find the best route between cities
  

### Requirements
- Basic knowledge of programming logic 
- Basic knowledge of Python is desirable
- Basic knowledge of Object Orientation is desirable
